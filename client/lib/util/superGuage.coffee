			# single argument t and returns a number between the starting angle and the
			# ending angle. When t = 0, it returns d.endAngle; when t = 1, it returns
			# newAngle; and for 0 < t < 1 it returns an angle in-between.

			# The return value of the attrTween is also a function: the function that
			# we want to run for each tick of the transition. Because we used
			# attrTween("d"), the return value of this last function will be set to the
			# "d" attribute at every tick. (It's also possible to use transition.tween
			# to run arbitrary code for every tick, say if you want to set multiple
			# attributes from a single function.) The argument t ranges from 0, at the
			# start of the transition, to 1, at the end.

				# Calculate the current arc angle based on the transition time, t. Since
				# the t for the transition and the t for the interpolate both range from
				# 0 to 1, we can pass t directly to the interpolator.
				#
				# Note that the interpolated angle is written into the element's bound
				# data object! This is important: it means that if the transition were
				# interrupted, the data bound to the element would still be consistent
				# with its appearance. Whenever we start a new arc transition, the
				# correct starting angle can be inferred from the data.
				d.endAngle = interpolate(t)

				# Lastly, compute the arc path given the updated data! In effect, this
				# transition uses data-space interpolation: the data is interpolated
				# (that is, the end angle) rather than the path string itself.
				# Interpolating the angles in polar coordinates, rather than the raw path
				# string, produces valid intermediate arcs during the transition.
